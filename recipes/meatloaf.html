        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>25 g/1 oz butter</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for brushing</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
            <li>100 g/3 1/2 oz carrots, very finely diced</li>
            <li>55 g/2 oz celery, very finely diced</li>

            <li>1 red pepper, deseeded and very finely diced</li>
            <li>4 large mushrooms, very finely diced</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried thyme</li>
            <li>2 tsp finely chopped rosemary</li>
            <li>1 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>6 tbsp tomato ketchup</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1.1 kg/2 lb 8 oz beef mince, chilled</li>
            <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>55 g/2 oz fresh breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>2 tbsp brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt the butter with the oil and garlic in a large frying pan. Add the vegetables and cook over a medium heat, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes until most of the moisture has evaporated.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat and stir in the herbs, Worcestershire sauce, 4 tablespoons of tomato ketchup and cayenne pepper. Leave to cool.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 160 C/325 F/Gas Mark 3. Brush a loaf tin with oil.</li>
            <li>Put the beef into a large bowl and gently break it up with your fingertips. Add the vegetable mixture, eggs and salt and pepper to taste and mix gently with your fingers. Add the breadcrumbs and mix.</li>
            <li>Transfer the meatloaf mixture to the loaf tin. Smooth the surface and bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make a glaze by whisking together the sugar, the remaining 2 tablespoons of tomato ketchup, mustard and a pinch of salt.</li>
            <li>Remove the meatloaf from the oven and spread the glaze evenly over the top. Return to the oven and bake for a further 35-45 minutes. To check the meatloaf is cooked through, cut into the middle to check that the meat is no longer pink. Any juices that run out should be clear and piping hot with visible steam rising.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and leave to rest for at least 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Slice thickly to serve.</li>
        </ol>
