    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Serves 4</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>250 g/9 oz macaroni pasta</li>
        <li>600 ml/1 pint milk</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp grated nutmeg</li>
        <li>55 g/2 oz butter, plus extra for cooking the pasta</li>
        <li>55 g/2 oz plain flour</li>
        <li>200 g/7 oz Cheddar cheese, grated</li>
        <li>55 g/2 oz freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large saucepan of lightly salted water to the boil. Add the pasta and cook for 8-10 minutes, or until tender but still firm to the bite. Remove from the heat and drain. Add a small knob of butter, return to the saucepan and cover to keep warm.</li>
        <li>Put the milk and nutmeg into a saucepan over a low heat and heat until warm, but do not bring to the boil.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a heavy-based saucepan over a low heat, then add the flour and stir to make a roux. Cook gently for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the milk a little at a time, whisking it into the roux, then cook for about 10-15 minutes to make a loose, custard-style sauce.</li>
        <li>Add three quarters of the Cheddar cheese and all the Parmesan cheese and stir through until they have melted in. Season to taste with salt and pepper and remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Preheat the grill to high. Put the macaroni into a shallow heatproof dish, then pour the sauce over.</li>
        <li>Scatter the remaining cheese over the top and place the dish under the preheated grill.</li>
        <li>Grill until the cheese begins to brown.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
